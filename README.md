# angular-custom-medium-editor
This is an Angular 2 directive for the [Medium.com inline editor clone](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) by Davi Ferreira, derived from the [AngularJS medium editor directive](https://github.com/thijsw/angular-medium-editor), and forked from progress made by Thijs on [angular-medium-editor](https://github.com/thijsw/angular-medium-editor).

Currently updated to support *Angular 7*
## Import the Module

Install with [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save angular-custom-medium-editor
```

[Medium editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) is a required peer dependency, so you'll need to install it alongside this angular wrapper:

```bash
$ npm install --save medium-editor
```

The `angular2-medium-editor` package should import medium-editor from your node_modules.

Finally, import the module into your project:

```typescript
import { MediumEditorModule } from 'angular-custom-medium-editor'
```

```typescript
  @NgModule({
    ...
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
    imports: [
      MediumEditorModule,
      ...
```

The module provides the directive to your app, and you're ready to use it in your templates.

## Usage

Use as an element:

```html
  <medium-editor [(editorModel)]="textVar"
      [editorOptions]="{'toolbar': {'buttons': ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3']}}" 
      [editorPlaceholder]="placeholderVar"></medium-editor>
```

You can optionally pass a placeholder value:

```html
  <medium-editor [(editorModel)]="textVar"
      [editorOptions]="{'toolbar': {'buttons': ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3']}}" 
      [editorPlaceholder]="placeholderVar"></medium-editor>
```

For more information on which options you can pass with [editorOptions], check MediumEditor's [options documentation](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor#mediumeditor-options) for details.
